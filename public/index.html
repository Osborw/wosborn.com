    <p>
      In 2019, I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 5 years, I have worked as a full-stack web developer for Travelers Insurance.
      I mainly develop in a React/TS stack with AWS hosted applications (both public and internal).
      Because of this, I'm often working with Terraform OSS to configure and deploy our applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this role, I also worked on the Travelers Application Security Team.

      Here, I used OWASP Zap and AppScan to identify security vulnerabilities within Travelers web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I love to travel. When that's not possible, I can be found cooking, visiting breweries, or
      shaving strokes off my golf game â›³.
